Are you new to the kingdom of the Essteling?” you nod in response; you had just arrived. “well it's nice to see a fresh face around, the kingdom has become quiet empty lately. The names Scribe, I’m the kingdoms librarian.” the man looked at you with a puzzled stare. “are you by any chance the new seeker?” again you nod in response. “that’s great, the kingdom could use some help.” He said cheerful. “Let me bring you to the castle, they probably want to see you as soon as possible.” You follow Scribe to the castle through the empty streets. “As you probably know the evil spirit has been taking away the stories and locking them up so not many people visit this part anymore.” Scribe sighs. “but now you’re here and can help us get them back.” The librarian brings you to the gate of the castle and goes back to the town.

You approach and hear what they are bickering about. “do you have any idea how long this is going to take with all the searching, researching and don’t forget the possible monster fighting.” The man said in a stressed tone. “long and dangerous but like I’ve said the past 20 times you need to get yourself up those stories aren’t going to free themselves” she snapped back at him. She sees you and looks you over. Then turns her companion to face you. “ow did you need something of us?” he said in an apologetic tone. “of course, Pardipsus that is obviously a junior seeker.” She said. Pardipsus narrowed his eyes looking at what you have with you and what you are wearing. “Ah yes, I think your right Zorna” he nods enthusiastically. “say if you’re a seeker then that must mean you’re here to help us, right?” Zorna asks you.

The two of them have obviously not been the greatest fans of cleaning. “As a fresh member of the seekers you probably don’t have much experience with the book of stories I suppose.” Pardipsus says. “so, let us help you with that.” they show you their books of stories pardipsus has a vibrant green covered one while Zorna has a grey one. “I have a colour-blind version because I can’t see colours, it helps me with using it.

Only with enough magic from the stories are we able to defeat the spirit.” Zorna points in her book. “To free the spirits we need to use a specific spell. The spell tends to change but it can usually be found close to the place where the stories are kept by the spirit.” Zorna explains to you. “if you use that spell with your book of stories you can start unbinding them. Read through the story and do the tasks that it requires of you. Only then are they freed.” You look at the Pardipsus’ book and see a large number of stories locked away. “This is a list of all stories we know of who have bene locked away. There might be more. I have given you a smaller list to begin with. you can find them here.” He says pointing to his book. ",

He worked hard and managed to build his house. Now if it would rain, he would be warm and dry he thought. The piglet was tired of his hard work and went to bed but was soon awoken by a loud stomping.

Sadly, the piglet had no axe of his own. The piglet had noticed that the woodcutter had missed a tree. “Why did you not cut that one?” the piglet asked. “It is too weak,” he said and knocked on it. “It's hollow you see” an echo could be heard through the tree.

That way they won't blow away.” The potter said before he helped the piglet build. Together they had fun building the piglets home. When the home was nearly finished the house only needed a door. The potter ran back to his house and came back excited with a small wooden door. “This used to be the door of my old oven, I want you to have it.” The piglet thanked him and together they put it in.

The wolf kept blowing and wheezing until he had no air left. That is when he laid down to see the house had not moved an inch.

Hansel and Gretel were often alone with their stepmother while their dad was working. Their stepmother didn’t like the children, but she only became cruel to them once the food started running low. One night hansel overheard his stepmother and father talk about the shortage. “Winter arrives soon, and we have barely any food left. We must leave the kids in the forest, that’s the only way we will have enough.” She said softly to her husband. His father didn’t want to hear any of it and told her it wouldn’t happen. Hansel wasn’t so convinced knowing what his stepmother was capable of. The next morning Hansel gathered some stones from the garden and put them in his pockets.

Hansel and Gretel walked hand in hand through the woods back home thanks to the trail of stones.

Well behaved Gretel started eating the bread but once their stepmother was out of sight Hansel grabbed his sister and started following the breadcrumbs back. To his surprise, the birds had eaten the trail. “Stupid birds, now we can’t find our way home.” He yelled at them. They walked on hoping to find the trail again, but they only got more lost.
