      "storyPartOne": "In a faraway forest there lived a mother pig with her three young piglets in their small house. The house became very crowded very quickly, so mother pig decided to send the piglets out to find their own house. The piglets complained but ended up listening to their mother. The next day the piglets set out, each piglet took a different direction. Mother pig waved them goodbye until they were nowhere to be found.",

      "storyPartThree": "The first piglet found a farmer who was gathering straw and sticks in his field. This confused the piglet, so he asked, “Why are you gathering straw and sticks, farmer?” The farmer responded, “To build a hut for my hens, so they are kept warm and dry.” The piglet was impressed by the farmer and decided to build his house out of straw and sticks too. He worked hard and managed to build his house. Now if it would rain, he would be warm and dry he thought. The piglet was tired of his hard work and went to bed but was soon awoken by a loud stomping.

      "storyPartFive": "A grey wolf had come to his house. “What is this? A piglet in a hut, can I enter?” the wolf wheezed. The piglet feared the wolf and said, “no big wolf, you may not. My house is too small for us both. The wolf was disappointed and said “Well then I will wheeze and blow your house away.” The wolf blew against the straw house and it fell apart. The piglet was sad to see his house like that and ran back to mother pig while sniffling “my house..., my house is gone!”"

      "storyPartOne": "The second piglet came across a woodcutter in the woods. “Why are you cutting so many trees, woodcutter?” the piglet asked. The woodcutter put down his axe and looked at the piglet. “So, I may build a house from these logs.” He explained. The piglet was amazed by the woodcutter and wanted a house of wood too. Sadly, the piglet had no axe of his own. The piglet had noticed that the woodcutter had missed a tree. “Why did you not cut that one?” the piglet asked. “It is too weak,” he said and knocked on it. “It's hollow you see” an echo could be heard through the tree. The woodcutter waved and went back to his house. “Good luck with finding your house!” he said. ",

      "storyPartThree": "The piglet peeped into the hollow tree and saw there was enough space in it for him. He squeezed himself through the opening and went to bed. The piglet did not sleep for long however for a grey wolf came stomping by. “What is this? A piglet in a tree, can I enter?” The wolf huffed. “No, no, you are too big. That wouldn’t fit.” The piglet squealed. “Well then I will wheeze and blow your house away.” the wolf blew against the hollow tree and it started to groan. The roots eventually let go and the tree flew away leaving the piglet behind. The piglet was sad and ran back to mother pig while sniffling “my house..., my house is gone”.",

      "storyPartOne": "The third piglet came by a potter, who was throwing bricks at his oven. “Why Does my oven only bake bricks?!” he yelled at it. The piglet looked at the pile of bricks. “What are you going to do with the bricks?” the piglet asked. “throw them away, I guess” the potter said. “Can I have them to build my house?” The piglet asked kindly. “Sure, take them” and so the piglet went to work with the potter watching him. “You will need to put clay between the bricks to keep them together. That way they won't blow away.” The potter said before he helped the piglet build. Together they had fun building the piglets home. When the home was nearly finished the house only needed a door. The potter ran back to his house and came back excited with a small wooden door. “This used to be the door of my old oven, I want you to have it.” The piglet thanked him and together they put it in.

      "storyPartThree": "As night started to fall the piglet went to bed only to be awoken by thumping.  “What is this? A piglet in a house, can I enter?” The wolf huffed. “No, no, I will not let you. It is too late in the night.” The piglet squealed. “Well then I will wheeze and blow your house away.” The wolf wheezed and blew with all its might, ripping leaves off trees. The wolf kept blowing and wheezing until he had no air left. That is when he laid down to see the house had not moved an inch. The piglet grinned as he saw his new neighbour run at the wolf with a broom. Tired and beaten the wolf ran into the woods never to be seen again. Now the piglet could live safely in his new house. ",

      "storyPartFive": "When the third piglet visited mother pig, he found his other two brothers sitting there. They told him what happened, and the third piglet decided he could help. So, the three of them went to work to build two more stone houses. Each for one piglet. And so, they all could live safely in their own homes. And mother pig finally had some peace and quiet."
