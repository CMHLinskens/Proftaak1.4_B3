Are you new to the kingdom of the Essteling?” you nod in response; you had just arrived. “Well it's nice to see a fresh face around, the kingdom has become quiet empty lately. The names Scribe, I’m the kingdoms librarian.” the man looked at you with a puzzled stare. “Are you by any chance the new seeker?” again you nod in response. “That’s great, the kingdom could use some help.” He said cheerful. “Let me bring you to the castle, they probably want to see you as soon as possible.” You follow Scribe to the castle through the empty streets. “As you probably know the evil spirit has been taking away the stories and locking them up so not many people visit this part anymore.” Scribe sighs. “But now you’re here and can help us get them back.” The librarian brings you to the gate of the castle and goes back to the town.

She sees you and looks you over. Then turns her companion to face you. “Ow did you need something of us?” he said in an apologetic tone. “Of course, Pardipsus that is obviously a junior seeker.” She said. Pardipsus narrowed his eyes looking at what you have with you and what you are wearing. “Ah yes, I think your right Zorna.” he nods enthusiastically. “Say if you’re a seeker then that must mean you’re here to help us, right?” Zorna asks you.

Only with enough magic from the stories are we able to defeat the spirit.” Zorna points in her book. “To free the spirits, we need to use a specific spell. The spell tends to change but it can usually be found close to the place where the stories are kept by the spirit.” Zorna explains to you. “If you use that spell with your book of stories you can start unbinding them. Read through the story and do the tasks that it requires of you. Only then are they freed.” You look at the Pardipsus’ book and see a great number of stories locked away. “This is a list of all stories we know of who have been locked away. There might be more. I have given you a smaller list to begin with. you can find them here.” He says pointing to his book. ",

One night Hansel overheard his stepmother and father talk about the shortage. “Winter arrives soon, and we have barely any food left. We must leave the kids in the forest, that’s the only way we will have enough.” She said softly to her husband. His father didn’t want to hear any of it and told her it wouldn’t happen. Hansel wasn’t so convinced knowing what his stepmother was capable of. The next morning Hansel gathered some stones from the garden and put them in his pockets.

The boy stomped off and went into the forest.  the path had been so often walked by the knights that it was easy to follow. The boy came across the clearing where the dragon sat. The dragon was guarding its chest and puffed a small smoke cloud out its nose. Its green scales shimmered in the dun and its breathing rumbled through the woods like thunder. When the boy got close the dragon made a loud noise and his eyes shot towards the boy. “who disturbs my slumber? Are you here to steal my treasure?” snarled the dragon. “no dragon I came here to admire you” said the boy. “i had never seen a dragon so large and strong before.” The dragon snorted and stared ahead. “that is fine but stay away from my treasure” “but I would also like to admire your treasure” said the boy. “can you open the lid of the chest so I can see it from here?” the dragon nodded and opened the chest. The boy walked closer till the dragon's eyes shot off back to him. “do not come closer, or I will burn you.” he growled. The boy stepped back. Now he knew how far he could until the dragon saw him. The boy kept trying the dragon's eyesight from different sides and noticed the front was its worst side. The boy started sneaking towards the treasure chest. ",

        "storyPartOne": "The boy crept back. “ow great dragon, you watch over your treasure so well, but I have to go back home now said the boy. “may I come by again?” he asked. “you may, you may come and admire me and my treasure every day if you wish.” he said with a proud smile on him. The boy promised to come by the next day and went home. At home he hid the treasure in his bedroom. The city laughed at him when he returned to them with empty hands, the boy knew better though. And so, the boy went back to steal one treasure each day until the chest was empty. When he took the last treasure, he told the dragon he wasn’t allowed to come back again and he was sad about that. He enjoyed the company that wouldn’t try to steal his treasures. The boy grabbed the bag where he hid the treasures in. He approached the king and placed the bag of treasures in front of the king. The king was surprised, and his eyes went wide. “well done, now I will knight you to knight …\" “Johan” the boy said. Johan was named knight but knew something about the king not many knew. The king too had bad eyesight and Johan used the same trick on him.  And so, knight Johan stole a treasure from the king every day until he had them all back. In the end he would live a rich life leaving the arrogant king and the dragon Argonant none the wiser of their stolen treasure.",
